# Sample Project

An ultra-minimalist portfolio system showcasing the power of simplicity and smooth interactions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how less can be more. By stripping away unnecessary elements and focusing on typography, spacing, and subtle animations, we create an experience that feels premium and intentional.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Scroll Animations** — Elements fade in as you scroll, creating a sense of depth and progression
- **Custom Cursor** — A subtle cursor that follows your mouse, responding to interactive elements
- **Modal System** — Full-screen project details with smooth transitions
- **Keyboard Navigation** — Use arrow keys to navigate between projects
- **Responsive Design** — Looks beautiful on all screen sizes

## Technical Stack

```javascript
const stack = {
  framework: 'Vanilla JavaScript',
  styling: 'Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS',
  markdown: 'Marked.js',
  animations: 'CSS Transitions + Intersection Observer'
};
```

## Design Philosophy

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This project embodies that philosophy. Every element serves a purpose. Every animation enhances the experience without overwhelming it.

## Interactive Elements

The site includes several interactive features:

1. **Scroll-triggered animations** that reveal content progressively
2. **Hover states** that provide subtle feedback
3. **Custom cursor** that adapts to different elements
4. **Parallax effects** that add depth without distraction

## Performance

Built with performance in mind:

- No heavy frameworks
- Minimal JavaScript
- Efficient CSS animations
- Lazy-loaded content
