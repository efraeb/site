# About

Product & Operations professional bridging creative vision and technical execution across design, analytics, and product development.

## Background

Currently working at [Vista](https://vista.wtf) — a data & engineering group helping organizations make better decisions through data systems, analysis, and modeling. As Product & Ops, I bridge the gap between creative vision and technical execution.

Based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, I co-founded [Ethereum Dominicana](https://ethereumrd.org), organizing events with Nouns and Devcon to kickstart the country's Web3 community from the ground up.

## Philosophy

I'm passionate about translating complex technical concepts into compelling narratives and building tools that bridge the gap between innovation and human understanding.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Product strategy & execution
- Data analysis & storytelling
- Community building & brand development
